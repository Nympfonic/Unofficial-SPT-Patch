# Unofficial SPT Patch (USPTP)

###### An assortment of performance improvements and bugfixes for SPT. Totally original name inspired by the Unofficial Skyrim Patches.

## Current List of Fixes

- Incompatible ammo in magazine notifications will no longer appear randomly
   - This was caused by a bot spawning with incompatible ammo loaded in its gun and the notification would appear if it tried to shoot its gun
   - This fix only prevents the notification from showing for the player, bots can still spawn with incompatible ammo
